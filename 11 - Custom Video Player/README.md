# Day 11 - Custom Video Player
The exercise provided custom controls for playing/pausing, scrolling, skipping, volume, and playback speed. This exercise involved writing the functionality of these controls for the custom video player.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned
I struggled with implementing the event listeners for the progress bar as it involved multiple event listeners. This exercise also taught me how booleans can be used to manipulate the state of elements.

This exercise taught me about the different methods and properties available to the `HTMLMediaElement` interface, namely `HTMLMediaElement.play()`, `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`, and `HTMLMediaElement.currentTime`. I also learned about `MouseEvent.offsetX` and `HTMLElement.offsetWidth` properties.
