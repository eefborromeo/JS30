# Day 12 - Key Sequence Detection
The goal of this exercise was to write the Javascript code that would allow the user to type in a "secret" key sequence that generated unicorns on the page through a file linked from Cornify.com.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned

I learned that if the start index in an `Array.prototype.splice()` method is negative then the method will start removing items from the end of the array.
