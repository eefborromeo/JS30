## What is Javascript 30?
[JavaScript 30](https://JavaScript30.com) is Wes Bos' Vanilla Javascript coding challenge. The course consists of building 30 projects in 30 days using only Vanilla JS - no libraries and no frameworks. The 30 projects are accompanied by 30 tutorial videos.

## Goal and Approach
My goal is to have a stronger foundation in Javascript. In order to meet it, I took the approach of watching the video only once each night and then starting on the respective challenge project the following day.

## Concepts Learned
Some of the concepts I learned during this challenge include (but not limited to): 

`Arrays`, `Promises`, `Array methods`,`Canvas API`, `Geolocation API`, `Navigator`, `Media Capture and Streams API`, `SpeechRecognition`, `Node`, `NodeList`, `localStorage`, `template literals`, `arrow functions`, `data-*`

Each project has my notes which expands on what I've learned and the struggles I encountered in completing the project.
