# Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
The challenge for Day 4 was to understand the different built-in array methods in Javascript.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned
Some of the struggles I encountered for this challenge was implementing the ternary operator, separating the first and last names, and understanding the `Array.prototype.sort()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` methods. To understand these methods better, I looked at other resources like [JavaScript Array Reduce by Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C40tDP0Bk)

I learned how to use and became more comfortable using the ternary operator and the following methods: `Array.prototype.filter()`, `Array.prototype.map()`, `Array.prototype.sort()`, `Array.prototype.reduce()`, and `String.prototype.split()`
