# Day 14 - JavaScript References vs Copying
This exercise presented the difference between referencing and copying when using Javascript Variables.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned
I learned that primitives and non-primitives act differently when you manipulate them using the variables you've declared them in. These are some of the ways to create copies of Arrays: `Array.prototype.slice()`, `Array.prototype.concat()`, `Array.from()` and ES6's spread syntax. `Object.assign()` is used to create copies of Objects.
