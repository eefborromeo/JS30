# Day 9 - Dev Tools Domination
This exercise presented different `console` methods and other browser tools that can be used to debug code.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned
I learned about interpolating and styling the `console.log()` results. I also learned about these different methods: `console.warn()`, `console.error()`, `console.info()`, `console.assert()`, `console.dir()`, `console.group()` and `console.groupCollapsed()`, `console.count()`, `console.time()`, and `console.table()`

No struggles with this exercise. I am happy to have these console methods in my toolbox now instead of having to rely on `console.log()` all the time.
