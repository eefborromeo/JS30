# Day 16 - Mouse Move Shadow
For this exercise, the `textShadow` of the provided `h1` element should move according to the movement of the user's mouse.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned
I struggled and learned about the difference between `HTMLElement.offsetTop`, `HTMLElement.offsetLeft`, `HTMLElement.offsetWidth`, and `HTMLElement.offsetHeight`. `HTMLElement.offsetWidth` and `HTMLElement.offsetHeight` were used to find the width and the height of the `div` element in relation to the window object. `HTMLElement.offsetTop` and `HTMLElement.offsetLeft` were used to find the distance the `textShadow` should move away from the `h1` element.
