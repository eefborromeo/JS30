# Day 13 - Slide in on Scroll
This exercise involved writing the Javascript code to allow images to slide into the screen where they should be displayed as the user scrolls through paragraphs.

## Struggles and Lesson Learned
I struggled in understanding the different properties needed to calculate the position of the page on the screen. Because of this, I learned about `Window.scrollY`, `Window.innerHeight`, and `HTMLElement.offsetTop`. I also learned that it is important to alway debounce a function if you are listening for a scroll event.
